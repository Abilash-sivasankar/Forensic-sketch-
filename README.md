# Forensic-sketch-


AI-Powered Speech-to-Facial Sketch Generation for Forensic Investigations 

This project automatically generates a sketch of a person's face by analyzing the spoken description given via voice recording.

## ✨ Project Workflow:

1. 🎙️ **User speaks** about the face features (example: "round face, thick eyebrows, curly hair...").
2. 🧹 **Voice cleaned** to remove noise and silence (using WebRTC VAD).
3. 📝 **Speech is converted to text** using Google Speech-to-Text API.
4. 🧠 **Facial features extracted** from text using NLP (spaCy).
5. 🎨 **AI Sketch Generated** using Stable Diffusion Model.
6. 💾 **Sketch image saved** and displayed to user.
